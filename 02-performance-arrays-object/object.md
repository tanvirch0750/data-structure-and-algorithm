When analyzing the **Big O complexity of objects in JavaScript**, we consider how common operations behave with respect to the **size of the object (number of keys)**. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **Common Object Operations and Their Big O**

1. **Accessing a Property: O(1)**

   - Accessing a value using a key is very fast.
   - Objects are implemented as hash tables, so accessing a key typically takes constant time.

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
   console.log(obj['name']); // O(1)
   ```

---

2. **Inserting or Updating a Property: O(1)**

   - Adding a new key-value pair or updating an existing one is a constant-time operation.

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = {};
   obj['name'] = 'Alice'; // O(1)
   obj['age'] = 25; // O(1)
   ```

---

3. **Deleting a Property: O(1)**

   - Deleting a property is also a constant-time operation.

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
   delete obj['name']; // O(1)
   ```

---

4. **Searching for a Key or Value: O(n)**

   - If you need to check whether a value exists or find a specific key, you need to iterate through the object, which takes linear time.

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: 'Alice', age: 25, city: 'Paris' };
   const hasValue = Object.values(obj).includes('Alice'); // O(n)
   ```

---

5. **Iterating Over Keys or Values: O(n)**

   - Iterating through all keys, values, or entries requires examining every property in the object.

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: 'Alice', age: 25, city: 'Paris' };
   for (let key in obj) {
     console.log(key, obj[key]); // O(n)
   }
   ```

---

### **Space Complexity of an Object**

The **space complexity** of an object depends on:

1. The number of keys (`n`).
2. The size of the keys and values.

For `n` key-value pairs:

- Space Complexity = **O(n)**.

### **Summary of Object Operations**

| **Operation**         | **Big O Complexity** |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Access by Key         | O(1)                 |
| Insert/Update         | O(1)                 |
| Delete                | O(1)                 |
| Search for Key/Value  | O(n)                 |
| Iterating Keys/Values | O(n)                 |

---

### **Comparison with Arrays**

- **Access**: Arrays and objects both provide O(1) for specific indexes/keys.
- **Search**: Both require O(n) for finding an element or key.
- **Insertion/Deletion**:
  - Objects: O(1) for adding/removing properties.
  - Arrays: O(n) for adding/removing elements at the beginning or middle (due to shifting).

Objects are better for **key-based lookups**, while arrays are better for **ordered data**.
